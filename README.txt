This is a web-based visualization of ccc-gistemp (http://code.google.com/p/ccc-gistemp/), the Climate Code Foundation's (climatecode.org) implementation of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP, data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/). Climate data is visualized using a map-based interface similar to Google Maps, built on an HTML5/Javascript framework.

This project is open source under the MIT License (LICENSE.txt) and available at code.google.com/p/ccf-mapview. We use Natural Earth Data (www.naturalearthdata.com), which is a great resource and in the public domain. Parts of the rendering were inspired by shapefile-js (github.com/RandomEtc/shapefile-js).

Concieved and executed as a part of the Google Summer of Code 2012.
